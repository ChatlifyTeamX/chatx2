                        users and employees. It outlines the specific measures we have implemented to ensure compliance
                        with data protection principles and to safeguard the rights of individuals whose data we
                        process.</p>

                    <h2>2. Data Protection Principles</h2>
                    <p>We adhere to the following data protection principles:</p>

                    <h3>2.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</h3>
                    <p>We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We provide clear
                        information about how we collect and use personal data through our Privacy Policy and other
                        notices.</p>

                    <h3>2.2 Purpose Limitation</h3>
                    <p>We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and do not process it
                        in a manner incompatible with those purposes. We clearly communicate the purposes for which we
                        collect data at the time of collection.</p>

                    <h3>2.3 Data Minimization</h3>
                    <p>We limit the personal data we collect to what is adequate, relevant, and necessary for the
                        purposes for which it is processed. We regularly review our data collection practices to ensure
                        we're not collecting excessive information.</p>

                    <h3>2.4 Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up
                        to date. We have mechanisms in place for rectifying or erasing inaccurate data promptly.</p>

                    <h3>2.5 Storage Limitation</h3>
                    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
                        We have established retention schedules and procedures for securely deleting data when it is no
                        longer needed.</p>

                    <h3>2.6 Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)</h3>
                    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against
                        unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.</p>

                    <h3>2.7 Accountability</h3>
                    <p>We take responsibility for how we process personal data and can demonstrate compliance with data
                        protection principles. We document our data processing activities, conduct impact assessments,
                        and maintain appropriate policies and procedures.</p>

                    <h2>3. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location and the applicable data protection laws, you may have some or all of
                        the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>

                    <h3>3.1 Right to Be Informed</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to be informed about how we collect and use your personal data. We provide
                        this information through our Privacy Policy and this Data Protection Policy.</p>

                    <h3>3.2 Right of Access</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as
                        information about how we process it. We will provide this information within the timeframe
                        specified by applicable law (typically within 30 days under the GDPR).</p>

                    <h3>3.3 Right to Rectification</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request that inaccurate personal data be corrected, or incomplete data be
                        completed. You can update much of your account information directly through your account
                        settings.</p>

                    <h3>3.4 Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten')</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances, such
                        as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when you
                        withdraw consent and there is no other legal basis for processing.</p>

                    <h3>3.5 Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain
                        situations, such as when you contest the accuracy of the data or when you have objected to
                        processing and we are considering whether we have legitimate grounds to override your objection.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.6 Right to Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and
                        machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller where technically
                        feasible. This right applies when processing is based on consent or contract and is carried out
                        by automated means.</p>

                    <h3>3.7 Right to Object</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to object to processing of your personal data in certain circumstances,
                        including when we process data for direct marketing purposes or when we process data based on
                        our legitimate interests.</p>

                    <h3>3.8 Rights Related to Automated Decision Making and Profiling</h3>
                    <p>You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including
                        profiling, that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you, except in certain limited
                        circumstances.</p>

                    <h3>3.9 Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
                    <p>Where we process your data based on consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
                        time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its
                        withdrawal.</p>

                        revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health data, etc.)
                        unless you explicitly provide this information (for example, in your profile) or where required
